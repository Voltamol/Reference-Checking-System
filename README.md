### System description in point form

- A reference checking system is a process that employers use to:
  
  > __verify the information provided by job candidates__
  
  > __gain additional insights into their past work performance__,
  
  > __strengths__,
  
  > __weaknesses__
  
  > __overall fit for a particular role__. 

- The system typically involves contacting the candidate's references - individuals who can vouch for the candidate's skills, experience, and character - and asking them a series of questions about the candidate's job performance, work habits, and other relevant factors. 

- The information obtained from the reference check is then used to assess the candidate's suitability for the role and to make informed hiring decisions. 

- A reference checking system can be an important tool for employers to ensure that they are hiring the most qualified and suitable candidates, and to minimize the risks of making a bad hire.
