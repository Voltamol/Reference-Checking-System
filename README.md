### System description in point form

- A reference checking system is a process that employers use to:
  
  > __verify the information provided by job candidates__
  
  > __gain additional insights into their past work performance__,
  
  > __strengths__,
  
  > __weaknesses__
  
  > __overall fit for a particular role__. 

- The system typically involves contacting the candidate's references - individuals who can vouch for the candidate's skills, experience, and character - and asking them a series of questions about the candidate's job performance, work habits, and other relevant factors. 

- The information obtained from the reference check is then used to assess the candidate's suitability for the role and to make informed hiring decisions. 

- A reference checking system can be an important tool for employers to ensure that they are hiring the most qualified and suitable candidates, and to minimize the risks of making a bad hire.



# System Objectives

1. Verification of Credentials: The primary objective of a reference checking system is to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the information provided by job applicants, such as their employment history, job titles, dates of employment, and educational qualifications.

2. Assessing Suitability: The system aims to assess the suitability of applicants for a particular role by gathering feedback from their previous employers or references. This feedback can provide insights into the candidate's skills, work ethic, attitude, and overall performance.

3. Confirming Experience: Reference checks help confirm the candidate's relevant work experience and determine if they possess the necessary skills and knowledge required for the position. This objective ensures that the candidate's claimed experience aligns with the job requirements.

4. Evaluating Performance: By gathering feedback from previous supervisors or colleagues, a reference checking system can evaluate the candidate's past performance, strengths, weaknesses, and overall abilities. This information aids in predicting their potential performance in the new role.

5. Cultural Fit: Assessing cultural fit is another objective of a reference checking system. It helps determine whether the candidate's values, work style, and interpersonal skills align with the organization's culture and team dynamics.

6. Reducing Hiring Risks: Reference checks aim to mitigate risks associated with hiring decisions by providing additional information about the candidate's reliability, integrity, and professionalism. This objective helps organizations make more informed hiring choices.

7. Identifying Discrepancies: Reference checking systems help identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies between the information provided by the applicant and the feedback received from references. This objective ensures that candidates are truthful during the application and interview process.

8. Legal and Compliance: Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is an important objective of a reference checking system. It helps organizations follow applicable laws, maintain fair employment practices, and protect against potential legal liabilities.

9. Enhancing Candidate Selection: By providing a comprehensive view of the candidate's background, skills, and qualifications, reference checks contribute to the overall selection process. This objective ensures that the most suitable candidates are chosen for the position.

10. Improving Hiring Decisions: Ultimately, the objective of a reference checking system is to improve the quality of hiring decisions. By gathering insights from reliable sources, organizations can make more informed choices and increase the likelihood of successful hires.
